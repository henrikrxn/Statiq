This is a consolidated repository of the core Statiq projects via submodules, which is helpful when developing and testing across the entire set of Statiq libraries. Individual issues and pull requests should be opened within the specific project:

- [Statiq Framework](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework)
- [Statiq Web](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web)
- [Statiq Docs](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Docs)

Note that this repository is mostly for Dave's use.
There's no reason you can't use it as well,
but it does require some extra work and a little undocumented magic
to get everything up and running.
